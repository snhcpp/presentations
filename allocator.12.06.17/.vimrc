""""""""""""" My cscope/vim key mappings
"
" The following maps all invoke one of the following cscope search types:
"
"   's'   symbol: find all references to the token under cursor
"   'g'   global: find global definition(s) of the token under cursor
"   'c'   calls:  find all calls to the function name under cursor
"   't'   text:   find all instances of the text under cursor
"   'e'   egrep:  egrep search for the word under cursor
"   'f'   file:   open the filename under cursor
"   'i'   includes: find files that include the filename under cursor
"   'd'   called: find functions that function under cursor calls
"
" Below are three sets of the maps: one set that just jumps to your
" search result, one that splits the existing vim window horizontally and
" diplays your search result in the new window, and one that does the same
" thing, but does a vertical split instead (vim 6 only).
"
" I've used CTRL-\ and CTRL-@ as the starting keys for these maps, as it's
" unlikely that you need their default mappings (CTRL-\'s default use is
" as part of CTRL-\ CTRL-N typemap, which basically just does the same
" thing as hitting 'escape': CTRL-@ doesn't seem to have any default use).
" If you don't like using 'CTRL-@' or CTRL-\, , you can change some or all
" of these maps to use other keys.  One likely candidate is 'CTRL-_'
" (which also maps to CTRL-/, which is easier to type).  By default it is
" used to switch between Hebrew and English keyboard mode.
"
" All of the maps involving the <cfile> macro use '^<cfile>$': this is so
" that searches over '#include <time.h>" return only references to
" 'time.h', and not 'sys/time.h', etc. (by default cscope will return all
" files that contain 'time.h' as part of their name).


" To do the first type of search, hit 'CTRL-\', followed by one of the
" cscope search types above (s,g,c,t,e,f,i,d).  The result of your cscope
" search will be displayed in the current window.  You can use CTRL-T to
" go back to where you were before the search.

""""""""""""" key map timeouts
"
" By default Vim will only wait 1 second for each keystroke in a mapping.
" You may find that too short with the above typemaps.  If so, you should
" either turn off mapping timeouts via 'notimeout'.
"
"set notimeout
"
" Or, you can keep timeouts, by uncommenting the timeoutlen line below,
" with your own personal favorite value (in milliseconds):
"
"set timeoutlen=4000
"
" Either way, since mapping timeout settings by default also set the
" timeouts for multicharacter 'keys codes' (like <F1>), you should also
" set ttimeout and ttimeoutlen: otherwise, you will experience strange
" delays as vim waits for a keystroke after you hit ESC (it will be
" waiting to see if the ESC is actually part of a key code like <F1>).
"
"set ttimeout
"
" personally, I find a tenth of a second to work well for key code
" timeouts. If you experience problems and have a slow terminal or network
" connection, set it higher.  If you don't set ttimeoutlen, the value for
" timeoutlent (default: 1000 = 1 second, which is sluggish) is used.
"
"set ttimeoutlen=100
